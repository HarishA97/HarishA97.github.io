title: Anecdotes from The Pragmatic Programmer
---

It's been 8 months in the software industry and it's been one heck of a journey already! I do plan to write something about that, but, that'll be in a while.

Today, I plan to write about something else. Something I just happened to pick up from my manager's desk, "The Pragmatic Programmer" by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. For someone interested, <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B07VRS84D1/ref=asc_df_B07VRS84D1/">here</a>
