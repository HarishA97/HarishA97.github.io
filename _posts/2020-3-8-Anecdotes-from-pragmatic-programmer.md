title: Anecdotes from The Pragmatic Programmer
---

My second blog!(after a loong loong time!)

It's been 8 months in the software industry and it's been one heck of a journey already! I do plan to write something about that, but, that'll be in a while.

Today, I plan to write about something else. Something I just happened to pick up from my manager's desk, "The Pragmatic Programmer" by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. For someone interested, you can find the book on amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B07VRS84D1/ref=asc_df_B07VRS84D1/">here</a>.

Now, the book a pretty big and covers various aspects and good practices. It's been around for 20+ years, it's gotta be huge. I'm not going to give out a nice summary of the book in one page. That would be insane! I just hope to provide a quick gist of the first few chapters. I hope to continue with follow-ups soon. I'd also want to mention that I will be skipping a lot of things. This is <b>NOT</b> a substitute to reading the book.

Let's get to it, then!

The first chapter was the most fun to read and probably offered some good advice. Here's few things that caught my eye:

<h3>The cat ate my source code.</h3>
That seemed like something I told my teacher about my homework, and yes, that's <i>exactly</i> what the authour meant too. Confused? The cat cannot possibly eat your source code. This just means don't make up excuses about something that's broken, instead, come up with options to fix it. Let's face it, no one likes a negative attitude. Bring all your positivity to work, and see how things change! When you start providing people with options to fix the problem instead of pointing out the problems, the problems start solving themselves. This seems like some solid advice for life as a whole too.

>Provide options, not excuses

<h3>The broken window theory</h3>
Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">The broken window theory</a>
The theory is, technically, about a city and how crime encourages crime. Like many other things, this can be applied to software development too.<br>
Imagine living in an old building that has broken windows(I mean the physical windows, not the microsoft ones) If you broke another window by accident, you would probably not care about it much. On the other hand, if the building was nice to begin with, you would probably loose your mind until you get it fixed. That's just how the human mind works!<br>
This applies to code as well. People are more likely to write good code if the code they began with was good too. So, start changing! Fix the windows you see broken, you'll get to an ideal point someday.

<h3>Boiled frogs</h3>
The authors mention the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">Stone Soup</a> story before they go into the boiled frogs story. For this post, I'm going to skip it. Let me know in the comments below if you want me to re-iterate the story.<br>
The boiled frogs theory(I genuinly hope it's a theory and not an experiment) is quiet an interesting one. It suggests an experiment where you throw a frog into boiling water. The frog jumps right out. Now, use the same frog, in a small bowl of water. Gradually start heating the bowl and notice how the frog stays put and eventually dies. The frog does not take action to gradual changes while it's quick to jump out when it's immediate.<br>
This is the case with most people and management. Make changes slowly and gradually to get to a state you dream of being in. This will take time, but, it'll happen. A huge project proposal might not be accepted immediately, but, give them a small prototype, something that's working, but, not in the greatest of form, that'll do the convincing. Small steps is what is more likely to work, rather than the big-bang approach.

> Keep an eye on the big picture and review things happening around you

<h3>Good enough Software</h3>
There is always software that is good enough. Software doesn't have to be perfect. The faster one acknowledges that, the better. We, has humans, try to be perfect, write perfect code. The authors mention that it's not always possible to be perfect and you have to learn to live with that. The code we write will not be perfect, but, it will be good enough. Good enough for the stakeholders.<br>
It's better to release good enough software to the world than spend eternity trying to write perfect code.


Finally, I'd like to sign off with few points that helps improve everyone:
1. Read a book every month
2. Communicate with people!

Good day everyone!
