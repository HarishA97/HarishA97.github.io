title: My First post!

Hello! This is my first post on this blog.

They say that the internet is to the 21st century what electricity was to the 20th. Going by that analogy, I believe Machine Learning will have to be called the bulbs. Everyone uses the end product, but, no one really knows how it works. I am one of those who wishes to learn now it works.

Computers have always fascinated me. The ability of man to make a machine do mundane tasks left me at aw. Although I wasn't very interested in computers, I always enjoyed programming and math. When I started my college education, the current advancements in the field of computers led me to combine math and computers. Oh, I loved it! 

I am an engineering graduate from R.V. College of Engineering based in Bangalore. I am interested in Machine learning and will use this blog to write about my interests in the field. I will start of explaining the basics of Machine Learning and make my way into what the field is today.

Join me in this journey!
